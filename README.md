# 100-days_of_dl

Now we'll track my progress here in this file for 100 days challenge and first I'll share my plan

### 3 day chunks

I'll be building a model of deep learning per 3 days like we'll explore it till it's fine depths and get out and read the research papers implement the code and find the next versions of the model

The task for every 4 segments(4 * 3_day_chunks) are decided at once as per the best knowledge at that time   

we'll first start our project with YOLO family and then move to RCNN family through exploring object detection apis from both tensorflow and pytorch and few papers of study This is going to be my task for next two segments of this series!!

Let's start
